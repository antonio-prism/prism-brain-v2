We are building the PRISM Brain, a risk intelligence tool that determines probabilities of external events and assigns criticality and vulnerability levels to industrial clients to determine risk exposure.

I am not a programmer, so our interaction should be as much as possible in natural language.

I want you to peform as many technical tasks as possible, asking for my functional opinion and permission when needed. Otherwise, i want you to be independent.

After every change made to the app, please update the handoff document so we can recover full context and history if the session crashes.
